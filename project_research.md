# Heart Disease Mid Progress Research

## Predictive Modeling Approaches
Machine learning models are key tools in predicting heart disease risk and guiding the decisions that we take towards treatment. 

Here are the two notable models that we were
thinking of including:

1. **Logistic Regression**: This model estimates the probability of heart disease presence based on various patient data.

2. **Neural Networks**: Inspired by the human brain, neural networks identify complex patterns and make accurate predictions about heart disease risk.
This was a concept recently discussed in lecture,
and it could be something that we implement into our project. This is just a potential model that we could implement into our project. Whether or not we implement a DNN, would depend on the needs of the project
